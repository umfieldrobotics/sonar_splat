    """Pytorch implementation of `gsplat.cuda._wrapper.rasterize_to_pixels()`.

    This function rasterizes 2D Gaussians to pixels in a Pytorch-friendly way. It
    iteratively accumulates the renderings within each batch of Gaussians. The
    interations are controlled by `batch_per_iter`.

    .. note::
        This is a minimal implementation of the fully fused version, which has more
        arguments. Not all arguments are supported.

    .. note::

        This function relies on Pytorch's autograd for the backpropagation. It is much slower
        than our fully fused rasterization implementation and comsumes much more GPU memory.
        But it could serve as a playground for new ideas or debugging, as no backward
        implementation is needed.

    .. warning::

        This function requires the `nerfacc` package to be installed. Please install it
        using the following command `pip install nerfacc`.
